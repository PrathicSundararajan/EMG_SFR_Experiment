# EMG SFR Experiment

This experiment was one of the class projects I participated in while completing BMED 3110 at Georgia Tech. We aimed to measure if exposure to emojis in context and out of context could elicit Subtle Facial Reactions (SFRs). 

## Programs Used

- Processing - Reads data in from serial port and saves recording to csv files 
- Python - Used to pre-process, recitfy and extract statistically significant values from recorded data
